    <hr>
    <div class="main">
    <p>On the DNA level, there's not much to distinguish humans from our closest relatives: chimpanzees
        and bonobos. At stretches of DNA that line up, human and chimp sequences are well over 90 percent
        identical.And, for the most part, the DNA does line up at genes; there are very few genes that are
        either human- or chimp-specific.</p>

    <p>That has meant most of the focus on understanding human evolution has been on small changes
        that can alter the timing or level of gene activity, and thus have an effect that's not proportionate to
        the number of bases changed.</p>
    
    <p>But that's not to say that newly evolved genes are irrelevant to human evolution. A paper released
        this week looks into how a class of new genes evolved since our split with our simian relatives. After
        gaining some insight into how this class evolved, the team behind the work looked at one of these
        newly evolved genes and found that it plays a key role in building bigger brains.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="subtitle">From RNA to protein</h2>
    <p>Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins. The information in DNA is transcribed into a 
        messenger RNA, which is then translated into a protein. If the protein's not made, then the gene
        doesn't do anything. But we've known for nearly 70 years that this isn't the only option. A number of
        genes that are transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins. Instead, the RNA performs a
        critical function.</p>

    <h2 id="subtitle">Export controls</h2>
    <p>One of the things they found was not surprising: Exporting these RNAs from the nucleus to where they could
       be translated was a key step. Most lncRNAs show up outside the nucleus at low levels, suggesting that the
       control of their localization isn't perfect. But the ones that had picked up a protein-coding function were
       found outside the nucleus at much higher levels. This appeared to be due to a weaker association with the 
       complex that splices out unused segments of RNA from messenger RNAs.</p>

    <p>Another thing that changed when lncRNAs became protein-coding genes: their role in genetic networks. Many 
       genes that are involved in similar processes tend to have coordinated activity—they all get activated or 
       shut off at the same time. Those networks can include a mix of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes.</p>

    <p>When these lncRNAs evolved into new genes, they essentially unplugged from the networks they were part of. 
       And this makes sense—the proteins they make are very unlikely to perform the same function that the lncRNAs
       did</p>

    <p>So, what is that function? The team decided to focus on one example, the catchily named ENSG00000205704, 
       which is active in brain cells and produces a small protein (107 amino acids) found in both the nucleus 
       and cell body. To study its function, the researchers altered the gene in stem cells, creating cell lines 
       that either lacked the gene entirely or activated it at high levels. The stem cells were then converted into
       neurons.</p>
       
    <p>In the cells that had ENSG00000205704 activated, this process produced a lot more neurons. This appeared to 
       be because the protein it encodes seems to keep neural stem cells in an immature state, allowing them to 
       undergo cell division more times before maturing into neurons. Deleting the gene caused an earlier maturation
       and cut down on the total number of neurons produced.</p>
