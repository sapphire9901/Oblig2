    <h1>How humans got a new gene that makes our brains larger</h1>
    <h2>Somewhere between chimps and us, an RNA started producing a useful protein.</h2>

    <h2>Enlarge / Building a bigger brain requires new genes, not workout</h2>
    
    <p>On the DNA level, there's not much to distinguish humans from our closest relatives: chimpanzees
        and bonobos. At stretches of DNA that line up, human and chimp sequences are well over 90 percent
        identical.And, for the most part, the DNA does line up at genes; there are very few genes that are
        either human- or chimp-specific.</p>

    <p>That has meant most of the focus on understanding human evolution has been on small changes
        that can alter the timing or level of gene activity, and thus have an effect that's not proportionate to
        the number of bases changed.</p>
    
    <p>But that's not to say that newly evolved genes are irrelevant to human evolution. A paper released
        this week looks into how a class of new genes evolved since our split with our simian relatives. After
        gaining some insight into how this class evolved, the team behind the work looked at one of these
        newly evolved genes and found that it plays a key role in building bigger brains.</p>
    
    
    <h2>From RNA to protein</h2>
    <p>Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins. The information in DNA is transcribed into a 
        messenger RNA, which is then translated into a protein. If the protein's not made, then the gene
        doesn't do anything. But we've known for nearly 70 years that this isn't the only option. A number of
        genes that are transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins. Instead, the RNA performs a
        critical function.</p>
